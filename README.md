# Air-quality-analysis

## General info
The analysis of the causality of weather on smog in Cracow. Meteorological and smog data comes from 2018 year. <br>
In the project I done exploratory data analysis, modeling linear regression in order to find important coefficients. It showed a significant causality of air temperature, humidity and wind speed to the level of air pollution.<br>
In the last section I implemented two machine learning models (MLP and LSTM) to find best predictions of the smog values based on weather. The LSTM model error rate was 7.08%.
